# Realm SDK for Flutter
Use the Realm SDK for Flutter to write client applications in
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) for the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
platform.

In addition to using the SDK with Flutter, you can also use the SDK with
projects that just use Dart, like a CLI application or web server.
The usage for the SDK with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you must
install and set up a separate package.

## Get Started with the Flutter SDK
These docs provide minimal-explanation code examples of how to work with the Flutter SDK.
Use the SDK's open-source database - Realm - as an object store on the
device.

> **TIP:** See the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start.md) to integrate
> Realm into your Flutter app and get started.

### Install the Flutter SDK
To get started, install the Flutter SDK.
Then, import the SDK in your project files.

### Define an Object Schema
Use Dart to idiomatically define an object schema.

### Configure & Open a Database
You can configure your database to do things like populate initial
data on load, use an encryption key to secure data, and more.

To begin working with your data, configure and open a database.

### Read and Write Data
You can:
- Create, read, update, and delete objects from the database on the device.
- Construct complex queries to filter data.

### React to Changes
Live objects mean that your data is always up-to-date.

Register a change listener to react to changes and perform logic like updating your UI.
